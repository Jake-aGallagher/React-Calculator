### created using react



#### Purpose of this app
The purpose of this app was to make a number and calculation focused app whilst also getting a chance to better my abillities with CSS Grid.

#### What I learned
Throughout creating this app I found that there can be a lot of edge cases that are difficult to account for, it also makes it difficult that the more familiar you become with your app the less you make mistakes when using it and so the less bugs you find by random chance.


#### What improvements could be made
A clear improvement here would be to add unit testing to double check that all things work as expected and to reduce the time take to find bugs.
